# Project Structure

All new pages should be created in src/app/pages 

The command should be `ionic g page` That will create a folder with the .module.ts, .page.ts, .html, and .scss

Any new services shoudl be created in src/app/services

The command should be `ionic g service` (I think) 

# Other Notes

Let's not worry too much about routing any buttons right now, we can do that after we build out all of the pages.
